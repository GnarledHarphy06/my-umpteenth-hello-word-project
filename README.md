# my-umpteenth-hello-world-project
Just trying Git Hub. I don't know if i shoud have choosen the 'somewhat experienced' or 'new to programming'. But, I guess learning from the scratch was't that bad :)

Okay, let's begin with me.
I guess my first commit shouldn't far too complicated.
Oh, my bad. I just noticed that I had a typo in the project name. Should have fixed it. :)
